## üì¶ How to get GX52
### Install from Flathub
This is the preferred way to get GX52 on any major distribution (Arch, Fedora, Linux Mint, openSUSE, Ubuntu, etc).

If you don't have Flatpak installed you can find step by step instructions [here](https://flatpak.org/setup/).

Make sure to have the Flathub remote added to the current user:

```bash
flatpak --user remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

#### Install
```bash
flatpak --user install flathub com.leinardi.gx52
```

#### Run
```bash
flatpak run com.leinardi.gx52
```

### Install from source code

#### Clone project and install
If you have not installed GX52 yet:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules -j4 https://gitlab.com/leinardi/gx52.git
cd gx52
git checkout release
sudo -H pip3 install -r requirements.txt
meson . build --prefix /usr
ninja -v -C build
sudo ninja -v -C build install
```

#### Update old installation
If you installed GX52 from source code previously and you want to update it:
```bash
cd gx52
git fetch
git checkout release
git reset --hard origin/release
git submodule init
git submodule update
sudo -H pip3 install -r requirements.txt
meson . build --prefix /usr
ninja -v -C build
sudo ninja -v -C build install
```

#### Run
Once installed, to start it you can simply execute on a terminal:
```bash
gx52
```

## Running the app
To start the app you have to run the command `gx52` in a terminal. The app needs to access the USB interface of the Kranen that, normally,
is not available to unprivileged users. 

To allow normal users to access the Kraken's USB interface you can 
create a custom udev rule

### Adding Udev rule
#### Using GX52
Simply run:
```bash
gx52 --add-udev-rule
```
It will automatically refresh also the udev rules.

#### Manually
Create a new file in `/lib/udev/rules.d/60-gx52.rules` containing this text:
```bash
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="06a3", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0762", MODE="0666"
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="06a3", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0255", MODE="0666"
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="06a3", ATTRS{idProduct}=="075c", MODE="0666"
```

After that, run the following commands
```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=usb --attr-match=idVendor=06a3 --action=add
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Build, install and run with Flatpak
If you don't have Flatpak installed you can find step by step instructions [here](https://flatpak.org/setup/).

Make sure to have the Flathub remote added to the current user:

```bash
flatpak --user remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

### Clone the repo
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules -j4 https://gitlab.com/leinardi/gx52.git
```
It is possible to build the local source or the remote one (the same that Flathub uses)
### Local repository
```bash
./build.sh --flatpak-local --flatpak-install
```
### Remote repository
```bash
./build.sh --flatpak-remote --flatpak-install
```
### Run
```bash
flatpak run com.leinardi.gx52 --debug
```

## ‚ùì FAQ
### The Flatpak version of GX52 is not using my theme, how can I fix it?
To fix this issue install a Gtk theme from Flathub. This way, Flatpak applications will automatically pick the 
installed Gtk theme and use that instead of Adwaita.

Use this command to get a list of all the available Gtk themes on Flathub:
```bash
flatpak --user remote-ls flathub | grep org.gtk.Gtk3theme
```
And then just install your preferred theme. For example, to install Yaru:
```
flatpak install flathub org.gtk.Gtk3theme.Yaru
``````

### Where are the settings and profiles stored on the filesystem?
| Installation type |                     Location                     |
|-------------------|:------------------------------------------------:|
| Flatpak           |        `$HOME/.var/app/com.leinardi.gx52/`        |
| Source code       | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (usually `$HOME/.config/gx52`) |

## üíö How to help the project
